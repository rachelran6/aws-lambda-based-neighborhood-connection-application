## Description of the application
This application intends to help people deepen their connections with others in the neighborhood. Sometimes, we want to play basketball while there's no teammates. People who feel lonely in the neighborhood may need company for a walk or a meal. Research has shown that loneliness is found throughout society, including among people in marriages along with other strong relationships, and those with successful careers. Therefore, this application aims to create opportunities for people in the neighborhood to connect with each other and have fun during the activities.

People can post events on this website as hosts, they can also join others' events. The events could be sports, entertainment, or daily routines like walking a dog. There's a map on the website that shows where the events are taking place at, which makes it convenient for people to look for the events that are close to them. Once they are interested, they can view the event details and go through the host's profile where shows the ratings of the events that the host has hosted before. They are able to leave messages for the host if they have questions or comments. They could also rate the event they joined after it finished. 

This application is helpful for those who want to have some connections with others while do not have many friends. It makes sense to join an event in the neighborhood since people would not have to drive a long way for an activity. This application allows users to communicate with hosts and to view the ratings of hosts' past events, which helps ensure that people could join the proper events. Hopefully, people can live a more colorful and happier life by attending the amazing events they shared with others on the website.
